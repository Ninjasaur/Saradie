	   <h2 class="sarah">Hi, I’m Sarah!</h2>
	  <p class="sarah1"> I love to write, draw, pet my cat and watch one of my 12 dvds relating to Batman. Mainly I draw though and have slowly been getting into making videos and that sort of stuff. Editing isn’t my favorite thing but gosh darn it I’ll get better at it sometime. 
		  I’m on deviantart a lot soooo check it out <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/burntshady" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>
	   <h2 class="sadie">Hello there fellow brethren, I am commonly known as Sadie. </h2>
	   <p class="sadie1">Enjoyable activities that I partake in are wearing out my shoes through miles of running and fooling around with <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub.</a> In addition to those, I am also a fan of cooking and collecting certain items.
