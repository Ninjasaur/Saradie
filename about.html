	   <h2 class="sarah">Hi, I’m Sarah!</h2>
	  <p class="sarahs"> I love to write, draw, pet my cat and watch one of my 12 dvds relating to Batman. Mainly I draw though and 
         have slowly been getting into making videos and that sort of stuff. Editing isn’t my favorite thing but gosh darn it 
         I’ll get better at it sometime. 
	I’m on deviantart a lot soooo check it out <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/burntshady" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>
	   <h2 class="sadie">Hello there fellow brethren, I am commonly known as Sadie. </h2>
	   <p class="sadies">Enjoyable activities that I partake in are wearing out my shoes through miles of running and fooling 
		   around with <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub.</a> In addition to those, I am also a fan of
		   cooking and collecting certain items. If you haven't been introduced to the beauteous world of Mech Keys, you should

	   <h2 class="ivy">Ivy.</h2>
	   <p class="ivys">773 years old. I like long walks on the beach and rewatching every loona music video so I can feel 
		   something... anything. I also like a lot of other things that may or may not be revealed over the course of the 
		   next 306 years of my lifespan. Check out my other YouTube channel <a href="" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
